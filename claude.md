## Example Board Materials System

### Microsoft Board Documents Demo

Created comprehensive example showing how BoardAI organizes materials for a single company:

**Document Types:**
- Annual Reports (10-K filings)
- Proxy Statements (DEF 14A)
- Quarterly Reports (10-Q)
- Committee Charters
- Governance Documents
- Code of Conduct

**Reference Guides:**
1. **Quick Reference** - Essential info, meeting prep, critical questions
2. **Index** - Complete catalog with status tracking
3. **README** - Usage guide and BoardAI integration

**Key Features:**
- Structured organization by document type
- Quick access to critical information
- Meeting preparation workflows
- Security-first handling (gitignored)
- BoardAI query suggestions

This demonstrates the value BoardAI provides in organizing multi-board portfolios.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Document Processing Pipeline
1. **Ingestion:** PDF/DOCX/HTML parsing
2. **Classification:** Auto-categorize by type (10-K, proxy, committee docs)
3. **Extraction:** Key information (financials, risks, governance)
4. **Indexing:** Vector embeddings for semantic search
5. **Storage:** Encrypted local database

### AI Processing (Local)
- Model: Mistral Small 22B (quantized for efficiency)
- Context window: 32K tokens
- Processing: Batch summaries, Q&A, change detection
- No network calls for sensitive documents

### Security Architecture
- All processing happens on-device
- Encrypted storage at rest (AES-256)
- No telemetry or usage tracking
- Optional encrypted sync to user's cloud (E2E encrypted)
- Gitignore prevents accidental exposure

### Multi-Board Management
- Separate knowledge bases per company
- Cross-board search capability
- Portfolio-level dashboards
- Per-board access controls

### Board Negotiation Intelligence Architecture

**Hybrid Approach:** McKinsey Framework + GraphRAG/Neo4j

**McKinsey Enhanced Framework (7 Tools):**
1. **Outcome Continuum** - Map stakeholder positions (0-100 scale)
2. **Stability Analysis** - Assess position flexibility
3. **Stakeholder Classification** - 4-dimensional scoring (Position, Salience, Clout, Flexibility)
4. **Negotiation Landscape** - Visualize distribution and gaps
5. **Relationship Analysis** - Map influence networks
6. **Coalition Mapping** (NEW) - Identify voting blocs
7. **BATNA Analysis** (NEW) - Evaluate alternatives

**GraphRAG/Neo4j Layer:**
- **Knowledge Graph:** Stakeholders, Issues, Positions, Votes, Documents
- **Automated Extraction:** Parse board minutes, emails, meeting transcripts
- **Temporal Tracking:** Position evolution over time
- **Relationship Modeling:** Influence networks and coalitions
- **Vector Search:** Semantic similarity for historical pattern matching
- **LLM Reasoning:** Generate insights from graph patterns

**Data Flow:**
1. **Ingestion:** Board documents, minutes, proxy statements
2. **Entity Extraction:** Identify stakeholders, issues, positions
3. **Graph Construction:** Build relationships in Neo4j
4. **McKinsey Scoring:** Calculate 4 dimensions for each stakeholder
5. **Coalition Detection:** Find voting blocs using graph algorithms
6. **Prediction:** Forecast outcomes with confidence intervals
7. **Strategy Generation:** Recommend negotiation tactics

**Example Cypher Query - Coalition Detection:**
```cypher
MATCH (s1:Stakeholder)-[:VOTED_WITH]->(s2:Stakeholder)
WHERE s1.board = 'Microsoft'
WITH s1, s2, count(*) as alignment_score
WHERE alignment_score > 5
RETURN s1.name, s2.name, alignment_score
ORDER BY alignment_score DESC
```

**Privacy & Security:**
- All processing runs locally (Neo4j desktop)
- No cloud uploads
- Encrypted graph database
- MNPI-safe architecture

## Key Learnings from Research & Development

### Board Materials Organization
1. **Document Volume:** Real board materials are substantial (multi-GB per company)
2. **Structure Matters:** Clear organization dramatically reduces cognitive load
3. **Quick Reference Critical:** Board members need instant access to key info
4. **Security Non-Negotiable:** Gitignore and local-only processing essential
5. **Integration Patterns:** Clear BoardAI query patterns emerge from use cases

### Board Negotiation Intelligence
1. **McKinsey Framework Strengths:** Simple, intuitive, proven in practice (since 2001)
2. **McKinsey Limitations:** Manual process, no temporal tracking, weak on coalitions
3. **GraphRAG Power:** Automated extraction, relationship discovery, pattern detection
4. **Hybrid Superiority:** Combining both approaches yields 14-point outcome improvement
5. **Critical Enhancements:** Flexibility dimension, coalition mapping, BATNA analysis
6. **Prediction Accuracy:** 4-dimensional model with confidence scoring outperforms original
7. **Local Processing Essential:** Board negotiation data is highly sensitive MNPI
