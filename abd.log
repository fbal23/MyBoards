## Technical Challenges

### Identified Risks
1. **AI Model Performance**: Can Mistral Small 22B run efficiently on M3/M4?
2. **Memory Constraints**: 32GB sufficient for model + documents + OS?
3. **Battery Life**: Impact of continuous AI processing
4. **PDF Parsing**: Handling complex board pack formats
5. **Semantic Search**: Quality of embeddings and retrieval

### Mitigation Strategies
- Benchmark Mistral Small 22B on target hardware
- Implement model quantization if needed
- Optimize for batch processing vs. real-time
- Test with real board packs from target users
- Evaluate alternative models if performance insufficient

---

## Security & Compliance

### Security Architecture
- Zero external API calls for sensitive data processing
- All AI inference runs locally
- Encrypted storage at rest
- No telemetry or usage tracking
- Optional sync only to user's chosen cloud (encrypted)

### Compliance Considerations
- GDPR-compliant by design
- No data collection or sharing
- Auditable open-source components
- Meets fiduciary duty requirements
- Suitable for insider information handling

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Launch Approach
1. Soft launch with personal network (board member contacts)
2. Testimonials from early adopters
3. Governance association partnerships
4. Targeted outreach to multi-board professionals
5. Nordic focus initially (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland)

### Marketing Positioning
**"The ONLY AI solution board members can actually use"**

Key messages:
- Not convenient. Compliant.
- Not cloud-first. Privacy-first.
- Built by a board member, for board members.

## Success Metrics

### Product KPIs
- Time saved per user (target: 250+ hours/year)
- User satisfaction score
- Document processing accuracy
- AI summary quality rating
- System performance on target hardware

### Business KPIs
- Customer acquisition cost
- Monthly recurring revenue
- Churn rate (target: <5% annually)

## Notes & Observations

### Why Now?
1. Technology maturity: Local AI now GPT-4 class
2. Hardware availability: 32GB MacBooks standard for professionals
3. Market timing: 2-3 year window before competition
4. Regulatory tailwind: Increasing GDPR enforcement

### Critical Success Factors
1. Trust in security architecture
2. Quality of AI summaries and insights
3. Ease of onboarding and use
4. Performance on target hardware
5. Word-of-mouth in tight board community

### Open Questions
- [ ] What is optimal model size vs. performance trade-off?
- [ ] Should we support Windows/Linux or Mac-only initially?
- [ ] How to handle multi-language documents (English + Nordic languages)?
- [ ] What's the best upgrade path as models improve?
- [ ] Should Enterprise tier include on-premise deployment option?

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-26: Microsoft Board Materials Demo Created

**Completed:**
✅ Created comprehensive Microsoft board documents folder structure
✅ Downloaded key governance materials:
   - Annual reports (10-K) for FY2022, FY2023, FY2024
   - Proxy statements (DEF 14A) for 2022, 2023, 2024
   - Audit Committee Charter
   - Code of Conduct documents
   - Quarterly 10-Q sample (Q3 FY2023)

✅ Created board member reference guides:
   - README.md - Complete folder guide with BoardAI integration
   - BOARD_MEMBER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Essential reference for board members
   - INDEX_Microsoft_Board_Materials.md - Detailed materials catalog

**Purpose:**
Demonstrates BoardAI's document organization system and value proposition using real-world board materials structure. Shows how board members would organize and manage confidential materials locally.

**Security Implementation:**
- All Microsoft board documents gitignored (MNPI protection)
- Created comprehensive .gitignore for confidential materials
- Documentation emphasizes local-first, zero-cloud architecture
- Demonstrates compliance with fiduciary duties

**Key Insights:**
1. Board members need structured organization for multi-company portfolios
2. Meeting preparation requires quick access to historical materials
3. Security/compliance is non-negotiable - gitignore critical
4. Quick reference guides significantly reduce cognitive load
5. Integration with BoardAI needs to be seamless and secure

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Initialize git repository
- [ ] Commit project structure and documentation
- [ ] Set up remote repository
- [ ] Begin technical prototyping of document parser
- [ ] Research Mistral Small 22B deployment on Apple Silicon

**Learnings:**
- Real-world board document volumes are substantial (multi-GB per company)
- Annual reports, proxy statements, and committee charters are foundation
- Quarterly earnings materials critical for ongoing oversight
- Governance documents need annual review and update
- Board member time is extremely valuable - automation crucial
