# BoardAI

**The ONLY AI solution board members can actually use.**

BoardAI is a local-first AI assistant designed specifically for professional board members who serve on multiple boards. Unlike cloud-based AI tools, BoardAI runs entirely on your MacBook, ensuring complete data sovereignty and compliance with fiduciary duties.

## The Problem We Solve

Professional board members face:

- **Cybersecurity blind spots** across portfolio companies
